# NBA Position Analysis

### Purpose:

In an NBA era that is highlighted by its leniency in terms of position-focused players, it can be difficult to identify similar players in terms of their play style as the preexisting definitions of positions like Point-Guards and Centers for example, no longer seem to apply to players in that position. 

By using the API from NBA.com, we were able to use unsupervised learning methods in order to identify this new generation of players with similar play-styles into clusters using K-means clustering. These clusters can then be used to correlate players based on play-styles which more accurately describe their ability and performance than just their position.
